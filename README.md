The title of this project is Shopular and it is for my Front-End class at The Iron Yard.
The author of this project is Christine Ash.
A brief synopsis of this project and the learning goals are as follows: I am building a web application for a shop's inventory. By the end of this assignment I should have a basic grasp of putting a couple of the pieces of Angular together to see data in my browser.

In order to create this project, here are the steps as follows:
1. Create a new repo on github and do the same on your machine by creating a new directory for the project.
2. Then create a src folder and add an index.html file. Within the src folder, create another folder for your js files. Then inside include your controller.js and modular.js files.
3. Finally, include a README, a .jshintrc file and a .gitignore to begin building your project.
